# ElbeWebSpring

⚠️ This is just a pile of ideas – I will probably not do anything about them! ⚠️

> The ElbeWebSpring is a full week of grassrots, non-profit community events around web design and development. It is framed by RubyUnconf and JSunconf on two following weekends and fills the week in between with lots of smaller events and space to meet new and old friends.

See http://wwwtf.berlin/ and https://2017.theconference.se/side-events/ as sources for inspiration

- the week *before* the week that contains may 1st -> **april 20.-28. 2019** (people often use that week of may 1st for extending the weekend – having some rest after a week of events is a good idea)
- rubyunconf could kick off with the weekend 20./21.
- 22nd - 26th would be for smaller and evening events — morning, afternoon, evening tracks, all synced in timing, eg 9-12, 14-17, 19-22. 9-17 "full day" events would be possible too of course. ( a) if times are not synced, it becomes really hard to keep overview as an attendee, b) this way it could stay relaxed with enough break time between tracks).
- Jsunconf could be the main and closing event on weekend 27./28.
- since May 1st ist Monday, that might be great for a full day Relax.JS at a Museum near the main station so people can drop in and leave easily.
- The Unconfs could stay completely independent in terms of sponsoring and governance
- We *could* organize central sponsoring for the smaller events. events can the ask for money from the pot
- i'd like to block at least a third of the week for design-related events and ping organizers and attendees of the UX Camp, Raumschiff Erde, UX Roundtable and Shapes UI Meetup



## The MKG as the main Hub

- is across the street from the main station
- [is amazing](http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/home.html)
- does rent out of event space (imagine having speaker dinners at the Spiegel Kantine http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/de/besuch/vermietung/spiegel-kantine.html or doing Relax.JS at the [Hubertus Wald Kinderreich](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=Hubertus%20Wald%20Kinderreich&tbs=imgo:1) in the basement 😱
- is near the central library, which has event space too

Not sure what is possible there with the MKG, but my idea of a "main hub" is a single point where I can always hang out and meet people related to the events. It can be small, but being lost in a city without knowing anyone and not knowing where to go as just awful.

## Involving Hamburg.de

- no specific ideas yet, but I might have fun working out a pitch which connects the "grassrots, non-profit community" apsect of our events to cultural community infrastructure like museums and libraries :)
